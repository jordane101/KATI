# KATI
The Kraken Automated Trading Interface (KATI) is a python program I have developed to use analysis from the Technical Analysis API and the Kraken Trading API to automatically determine buying and selling of cryptocurrency.

You can find the Technical Analysis API at this address: https://technical-analysis-api.com/
And the Kraken exchange is at: kraken.com

Currently I am just testing the viability of this concept and the flexibility of the script is low priority. I am making this code public so that anyone can stumble across it and possibly give me some tips.

This is a rough start of what the GUI might possibly look like in the future. Currently the analysis is being done fully from an API. The main concept behind this project is the automatic trading.
