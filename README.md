# KATI
The Kraken Automated Trading Interface (KATI) is a python program I have developed to use analysis from the Technical Analysis API and the Kraken Trading API to automatically determine buying and selling of cryptocurrency.

And the Kraken exchange is at: kraken.com

Currently I am just testing the viability of this concept. I am making this code public so that anyone can stumble across it and possibly give me some tips.

I had some trouble getting the GUI to space out when loading in, but the idea is there. 

Currently, only Bitcoin and Ethereum are fully working with this version, other coins can be tracked but not traded. Full support for all is coming soon.

REQUIREMENTS:
a kraken account and api key/ secret key pair
a keys.env file in the same folder as main.py with the api keys labeled as 'API_KEY_KRAKEN' and 'API_SEC_KRAKEN' respectively.


Happy Trading!!
